## Welcome

This is a data science project that focuses on pattern analysis and aims at avocado price prediction. I apply rapid analysis using time series analysis and to predict i use automatic machine learning.

The following sections are on this project:
1. Data Analysis: in this section I provide a brief analysis overview.
2. Time Series Analysis: in this section I discuss time series analysis on data from trends, seasonality, etc.
3. Time Series Forecasting: in this section I define the model that I want to test, compare the models, and then choose the best model for forecasting.
